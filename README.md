## Summary
Hey there! I'm Mohammed, a software engineer passionate about building responsive web applications and contributing to open-source projects. I founded Prisma Editor and love solving complex problems while enhancing team productivity. 

You might say I approach coding like a game of chess - strategic, methodical, and always thinking several moves ahead. But unlike chess, in programming, the pawns drink coffee, the knights debug, and the queen is a well-commented function that does all the work!
