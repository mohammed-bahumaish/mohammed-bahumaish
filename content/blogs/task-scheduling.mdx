Scheduling tasks in a web application allows you to automate repetitive actions like sending notifications or updating records. In this post, weâ€™ll walk through creating a simple task scheduling system in a Next.js application using a simulated database. This approach focuses on demonstrating core concepts with minimal code.

## The Concept

Our task scheduling system consists of three main parts:

1. **Task Definition:** Define what tasks you want to perform.
2. **Task Scheduling:** Schedule these tasks to run at specific times.
3. **Task Execution:** Execute the tasks when they are due.

### 1. Task Definition

First, we define the tasks we want our system to handle. Let's consider a simple task that logs a message:

```javascript
const registeredTasks = {
  'log-message': async ({ message }) => {
    console.log(message);
    return message;
  },
};
```

Here, `registeredTasks` is a collection of tasks our system knows how to run. We can add more tasks as needed.

### 2. Task Scheduling

Next, we simulate a database with a simple array and schedule tasks by adding them to this array:

```javascript
const simulatedDatabase = [];

const scheduleTask = ({ task, data, runAt }) => {
  simulatedDatabase.push({
    task,
    data,
    runAt,
    state: 'scheduled',
  });
};
```

This function schedules a task by storing it in our simulated database with the time it should run.

### 3. Task Execution

Finally, we create a function that periodically checks for tasks that are ready to run:

```javascript
const runScheduledTasks = () => {
  const now = new Date();

  simulatedDatabase.forEach(async (task) => {
    if (task.state === 'scheduled' && task.runAt <= now) {
      try {
        const result = await registeredTasks[task.task](task.data);
        task.state = 'completed';
        task.result = result;
      } catch (error) {
        task.state = 'failed';
        task.error = error;
      }
    }
  });
};
```

This function loops through the tasks in our simulated database, runs those that are due, and updates their status.

## Conclusion

By defining tasks, scheduling them, and executing them at the right time, we've built a simple yet effective task scheduling system. Although we used a simulated database, the same principles apply when integrating with a real database in production. This approach can be easily extended to handle more complex tasks and scheduling requirements.
